### Note
As description is to make "function" I have opted to create implementation in a class library where the best way to run and test is with unit tests.

### How to run
Best way to run:
1. Git this repo: --> https://github.com/davidomahony/birthday
2. Open solution in visual studio (Solution files: birthday\birthday\birthday.sln)
3. In the unit test project there is a class called ValidateBirthdayService which has a function called demo test which can be used for testing.
